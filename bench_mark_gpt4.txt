IMAGE NUMBER: 4, Filename: a_rail_road_sign.png 
Question asked: is the sign flashing?s 
Query time: 15.608822345733643s 
Answer: Based on this still image, I cannot confirm whether the lights are flashing or not, as this would require a video to observe any movement. However, in the current image, the lights appear to be illuminated, indicating that there may be a train approaching or that the signals are activated for some reason. Railway crossing signals typically flash when a train is nearing a crossing as a warning to motorists and pedestrians to stop and wait until the train has passed and the signals have stopped flashing.s
