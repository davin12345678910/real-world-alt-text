Answer: The people on the bikes are wearing different things, kiddo.

Then there's another person, we can call them person3, who is wearing a white hat – it might be a helmet too, to keep safe just like person1's helmet – and they are riding a black bicycle. And lastly, there's person5, described as a man in an orange shirt, riding his bike, but we don't have more details about his clothes from the information I can see. Isn't it fun to imagine all their colorful outfits while they zoom by on their bicycles?s
